Novels generated for [NaNoGenMo 2016](https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2016/).

## Completed Works

- **[*Moby Dick (hehe)*](moby-dick-hehe/)** â€” A juvenile remix of the classic novel.

## Ideas

- **A book comprised entirely of neologisms.**
  - Grab 500 Gutenberg texts and extract the words that don't appear in a c. 1900 dictionary.
  - Use sentence templates or tropes to just ad-lib the neologisms in, so that it's more 'readable?'
  
  
- **Paragraphs of sentences that fluctuate.**
  - Pick a sentence at random and mutate it from the first to the second to the third person.
  - Pick a sentence at random and gradually replace more and more of its words with more florid synonyms.
  
  
- **A book entirely of 1) sentences ending in exclamation points and 2) single-word sentences.**
  - Could be from Gutenberg texts, like [@obliquestions](https://twitter.com/obliquestions), or it might be interesting to try and grab them from news articles?
